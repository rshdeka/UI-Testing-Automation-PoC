# UI-Testing-Automation-PoC

This PoC is an innovative approach to UI browser testing automation, utilizing Prompt Engineering, BrowserUse and Playwright. BrowserUse connects AI agents with the UI browser and uses prompts to enable efficient automation and validation of UI browser functionalities. By combining BrowserUse and Playwright, I have executed various test scenarios and analyzed the results effectively.
The system dynamically generates prompts for BrowserUse agent, and also dynamically generates the Playwright automation scripts based on the test cases.

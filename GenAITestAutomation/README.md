# UI-Testing-Automation-PoC

This PoC is an innovative approach to UI browser testing automation, utilizing Prompt Engineering, BrowserUse and Playwright.
BrowserUse connects AI agents with the UI browser and uses prompts to enable efficient automation and validation of UI browser functionalities. 
The system utilizes Prompt Engineering to generate the fallback mechanism (controller actions) dynamically for each test case based on the steps defined.
These controller actions are generated dynamically through prompts - and they provide a good skeleton. We can then copy those and manually add more actions to make it work precisely.
By combining BrowserUse and Playwright, I have executed various test scenarios and analyzed the results effectively.
